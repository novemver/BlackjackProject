# Blackjack Project

# Description
This program is a Blackjack game. The Player will play against a virtual Dealer with a virtual Deck of playing cards.
The game will be dealt upon starting the program. The Player will have the option to input the choice to 1. Hit, to receive a card or 2. Stay, to not be given another card. Depending on the score of the Dealer's hand the Dealer will draw or stay accordingly.

# Lessons Learned
While creating this program I am trying to practice keeping my data well encapsulated. Encapsulation is modifying or keeping certain fields and methods in a class from being accessed from outside their class without explicit instructions to do so. The way these instructions to send messages; about data and what to do with that data, depends on how which Access Modifier is modifying or mutating a field or method's visibility.
